    <title>Shape</title>
    <text>Is the galaxy in the centre of the image simply smooth and rounded, or does it have features?</text>
    <help>The aim here is to divide featureless galaxies from all the rest. If you can see any interesting features at all, click "features." Just occasionally you might see something that isn't a galaxy at all — the long streak of a satellite, for example, or an image swamped by light from a bright star. If this happens, just click "star or artifact". Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Disk</title>
    <text>Could this be a disk viewed edge-on?</text>
    <help>Disc galaxies are very thin, so they look different when viewed from the side. We're trying to find exactly edge-on galaxies with this question. If the galaxy looks needle-like, perhaps with a bulge at the centre, then click "yes," otherwise choose "no" (even for galaxies that are almost edge-on).

  <question xmlns="" id="gama-10">
    <title>Odd</title>
    <text>Do you see any of these odd features in the image?</text>
    <help>These are examples of galaxy morphology that are rare, but still important to note when you see them. You can select more than one option if you see multiple features in the same galaxy. Ring galaxies have a bright circle of stars around the edge of the galaxy. Lenses and arcs are curved, detached bands of light that can be caused by gravitational lensing. Irregular galaxies have shapes that are neither smooth ellipses or well-behaved spirals, but look more like a chaotic blob. Dust lanes are thin, dark features across a galaxy that resemble shadows. Overlapping galaxies occur when two galaxies appear to be located at least partially on top of each other, but where you don't see any distortions or features that would indicate a merger.

    <title>Bar</title>

    <title>Bulge</title>
    <text>How prominent is the central bulge, compared with the rest of the galaxy?</text>
    <help>It's not always easy to tell, but look at the centre of the galaxy for a round bulge of stars which may obscure any bar and the spiral arms in this central region. If you see a bulge, rank its size and brightness compared to the rest of the galaxy's disk. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Spiral</title>
    <text>How many spiral arms are there?</text>
    <help>Some spiral galaxies are rather complicated, but we want your best guess as to how many individual arms you can see. Note that the arms don't always begin at the very centre of the galaxy. If there are more than four arms, don't worry about counting them individually, but select the "more than 4" button. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Bulge</title>
    <text>Does the galaxy have a bulge at its centre?</text>
    <help>Concentrate on the centre of the galaxy — if it has a smooth, uninterrupted, needle or lens-shape then click "no bulge." Otherwise your options are "rounded" or "boxy" bulges (but boxy bulges are rare). Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Round</title>
    <text>How rounded is it?</text>

    <title>Mergers</title>
    <text>Is the galaxy currently merging or is there any sign of tidal debris?</text>
    <help>Now you can look at the larger picture — if the galaxy is colliding with another, click "merger." If there's no visible second system, but long streams of stars or gas are visible then click "tidal debris." "Both" and "Neither" are your other options.
