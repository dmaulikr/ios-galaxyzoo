    <title>Shape</title>
    <text>Is the galaxy simply smooth and rounded, with no sign of a disk?</text>
    <help>The aim here is to divide featureless galaxies from all the rest. If you can see any interesting features at all, click "features or disk." Just occasionally you might see something that isn't a galaxy at all — the long streak of a satellite, for example, or an image swamped by light from a bright star. If this happens, just click "star or artifact". Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

  <question id="illustris-1">
    <title>Disk</title>
    <text>Could this be a disk viewed edge-on?</text>
    <help>Disc galaxies are very thin, so they look different when viewed from the side. We're trying to find exactly edge-on galaxies with this question. If the galaxy looks needle-like, perhaps with a bulge at the centre, then click "yes," otherwise choose "no" (even for galaxies that are almost edge-on).

    <title>Odd</title>
    <text>Is there anything odd?</text>
    <help>We're looking for signs that the galaxy is merging, is disturbed, or has other unusual features. If you see anything, just click "Yes" and you can identify the specific type of feature in the next step. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Bar</title>
    <text>Is there any sign of a bar feature through the center of the galaxy?</text>
    <help>Sometimes galaxies have a prominent straight "bar" running through their centre, and that's what we're looking for here. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Bulge</title>
    <text>How prominent is the central bulge, compared with the rest of the galaxy?</text>
    <help>It's not always easy to tell, but look at the centre of the galaxy for a round bulge of stars which may obscure any bar and the spiral arms in this central region. If you see a bulge, rank its size and brightness compared to the rest of the galaxy's disk. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

  <question id="illustris-5">
    <title>Odd</title>
    <text>Do you see any of these odd features in the image?</text>
    <help>Ring galaxies have a bright circle of stars around the edge of the galaxy. Lenses and arcs are curved, detached bands of light that can be caused by gravitational lensing. Disturbed galaxies may have a kink or warp through the center. Irregular galaxies have shapes that are neither smooth ellipses or well-behaved spirals, but look more like a chaotic blob. Mergers happen when galaxies pass near each other, often resulting in long tails of stars stripped out of the galaxies by gravity. Dust lanes are thin, dark features across a galaxy that resemble shadows. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Round</title>
    <text>How rounded is it?</text>
    <help>Not all galaxies are perfectly round - just look at the overall shape and put it in one of these three categories. If there's more than one galaxy in the field, remember always to concentrate on the one in the centre. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <text>Does the galaxy have a bulge at its center? If so, what shape?</text>
    <help>Concentrate on the centre of the galaxy — if it has a smooth, uninterrupted, needle or lens-shape then click "no bulge." Otherwise your options are "rounded" or "boxy" bulges (but boxy bulges are rare). Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>

    <title>Spiral</title>

    <title>Spiral</title>
    <text>How many spiral arms are there?</text>
    <help>Some spiral galaxies are rather complicated, but we want your best guess as to how many individual arms you can see. Note that the arms don't always begin at the very centre of the galaxy. If there are more than four arms, don't worry about counting them individually, but select the "more than 4" button. Click on the images to see larger examples.</help>
